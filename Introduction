Hi, my name is Rogério Júnior and i'm a student at UFRPE (yes, i'm from Brazil) trying to learn one step at a time how to become a true programmer.
My main language is Python, but i also like js and html (although i don't know much about how to use them yet), but i'm hear to learn as much as i can.
At the moment i'm looking for projects to contribute and earn more experience.
May the force be with you <3
